        "\t\t<p>I found an interview online of an entrepreneur who was asked what to major in should someone want to be an entrepreneur&#8230;  He discussed the idea that majors do not always translate into careers and then continued to say &#8221; the best advice ever given to me was to choose my major as if I were to die at graduation&#8230;&#8221;. I&#8217;ve been repeating that quote for almost a week, so much that it&#8217;s become my mantra while here, in life limbo&#8230;  So far I only know that chemistry isn&#8217;t what I want to be doing with my life and should I die at graduation the one thing I would regret not studying is philosophy.  The one thing I would regret not doing is traveling the world, meeting new people, helping make the world a better place &#8211; not indrectly, but directly.  I want to create ways for people to live happier, easier, less stressful lives.  It was after realizing this that people began telling me I would make a good diplomat or detective or something like that&#8230;  I&#8217;m closer to where I&#8217;m supposed to be but I&#8217;m not quite there just yet..  </p>\n",

I talk to him from time to time about people he&#8217;s met, chemistry, engineering&#8230;  Just shootin shit pretty much&#8230;  Today, not more than 10 minutes ago, I asked him for his opinion on the quote, my mantra..  His response went something like this:</p>\n",
        "<p>&#8220;What that means to me, is that it&#8217;s very important to study something you love and that is rudimentary to your happiness.  You shouldn&#8217;t have to struggle to read or study something [that will be critical to the rest of your life].  Study something you love; love is the most powerful thing God gave us &#8211; USE IT!&#8221;</p>\n",

        "         If I\u2019ve learned anything from watching anime, it\u2019s that you need to understand your own dark side, accept it and embrace it. \u00a0If you don\u2019t, you lose the capacity for reason, and also turn into a rampaging living form of energy in the shape of a giant fox.\n",

        "         All fanboyism aside, this very sensible concept led me to wonder \u2013 what is it that permits us to reason and accept the parts of humanity that we would prefer to turn our backs on or even refuse to acknowledge? \u00a0Must we first be capable of reason in order to accept the evils of humanity? \u00a0Do those who never really face their demons simply fail to reason with themselves? \u00a0Are they just cursed with a smaller capacity to reason, or a larger sense of evil? \u00a0Perhaps both are possible. \u00a0Maybe the key is simply intent. \u00a0Those who choose to reason make themselves reason and those who choose not to just don\u2019t.\n",

        "         If that\u2019s the case, what is it then that influences us to reason? \u00a0What makes us choose to acknowledge humanity\u2019s capacity for evil? \u00a0What could possibly influence someone to look at evil and say \u201cI understand\u201d? \u00a0Of course, there are many mechanisms constructed to defend us from such a dark place. \u00a0The first that comes to mind is the idea that an omnipotent force will determine what happens to the good and the evil, freeing us from the burden of coming to terms with ourselves. \u00a0We construct ways to absolve us from dealing with what makes us human. \u00a0If we know what it is that allows us to understand evil however, we might have the opportunity to better deal with it.\n",

        "         Perhaps those who are more inclined to understand evil have had more experience with it. \u00a0Those who find reason in the dark recesses of humanity may have spent time walking around in it, lost and finding a way out, or even just looking around. \u00a0The first thing I am reminded of are dark humor comedians. \u00a0Comedy and tragedy are classically polar opposites, however I think comedy is tragic in a way. \u00a0Sometimes it draws the line where many people are afraid to go, it identifies a darkness that some people refuse to acknowledge \u2013 and that in itself is a tragedy.\n",

        "         Now I can see where most people might be afraid of socialism, the rich afraid of losing power, and the poor afraid of submitting themselves to the government instead of private companies. \u00a0It seems depressing though to think that America as a people are incapable of watching the transfer of power from conglomerates to the government without actively revolting. \u00a0Socialism, especially in the state of our economy, is best for the people. \u00a0The minimum wage worker struggling to pay their bills will no longer have to sweat blood and tears while the CEO running the company they work for flies out to exotic countries to play golf with other CEOs. \u00a0Instead, CEOs give up the jets they own so that poorer citizens can afford the luxuries that most people call necessities such as a mode of transportation, or an education. \u00a0What is scary about socialism IS the overtaking of power by the government. \u00a0This is because of the conditioning we have been submitted to through the submersion of common knowledge in the propaganda filtered through the media. \u00a0We see other socialist countries that have succumbed to their leaders and see that the people are oppressed. \u00a0Therefore, we associate socialism with oppression. \u00a0However, I strongly believe that should the government take power from privately owned companies, and furthermore from the people, We as a country would not stand idly by to watch and cry. \u00a0Americans are much stronger than that, there will come a time when the economy that is falling down onto us will cause this house to collapse, and the only people that will be up to the task of rebuilding it are US.\n",

The one thing I would regret not doing is traveling the world, meeting new people, helping make the world a better place \u2013 not indrectly, but directly.  I want to create ways for people to live happier, easier, less stressful lives.  It was after realizing this that people began telling me I would make a good diplomat or detective or something like that\u2026  I\u2019m closer to where I\u2019m supposed to be but I\u2019m not quite there just yet..\n",

        "Random thought that occurred to me as I was lying in bed:\n",
        "If I\u2019ve learned anything from watching anime, it\u2019s that you need to understand your own dark side, accept it and embrace it. \u00a0If you don\u2019t, you lose the capacity for reason, and also turn into a rampaging living form of energy in the shape of a giant fox. \u00a0\n",
        "All fanboyism aside, this very sensible concept led me to wonder \u2013 what is it that permits us to reason and accept the parts of humanity that we would prefer to turn our backs on or even refuse to acknowledge? \u00a0Must we first be capable of reason in order to accept the evils of humanity? \u00a0Do those who never really face their demons simply fail to reason with themselves? \u00a0Are they just cursed with a smaller capacity to reason, or a larger sense of evil? \u00a0Perhaps both are possible. \u00a0Maybe the key is simply intent. \u00a0Those who choose to reason make themselves reason and those who choose not to just don\u2019t. \u00a0\n",
        "If that\u2019s the case, what is it then that influences us to reason? \u00a0What makes us choose to acknowledge humanity\u2019s capacity for evil? \u00a0What could possibly influence someone to look at evil and say \u201cI understand\u201d? \u00a0Of course, there are many mechanisms constructed to defend us from such a dark place. \u00a0The first that comes to mind is the idea that an omnipotent force will determine what happens to the good and the evil, freeing us from the burden of coming to terms with ourselves. \u00a0We construct ways to absolve us from dealing with what makes us human. \u00a0If we know what it is that allows us to understand evil however, we might have the opportunity to better deal with it.\n",
        "Perhaps those who are more inclined to understand evil have had more experience with it. \u00a0Those who find reason in the dark recesses of humanity may have spent time walking around in it, lost and finding a way out, or even just looking around. \u00a0The first thing I am reminded of are dark humor comedians. \u00a0Comedy and tragedy are classically polar opposites, however I think comedy is tragic in a way. \u00a0Sometimes it draws the line where many people are afraid to go, it identifies a darkness that some people refuse to acknowledge \u2013 and that in itself is a tragedy.\n",
        "It is quite the dilemma\u2026 \u00a0In order to face darkness one must not be afraid of the unknown. \u00a0In order to not be afraid of the unknown one must conquer fear. \u00a0In order to conquer fear one must embrace the unknown, and in order to embrace the unknown \u2013 that\u2019s right: one must face darkness.\n",

        "We live in marvelous times. \u00a0Amid the fever of global economic strife, the dawn of a new era in physics, a waning period for consumer technology, and only weeks before \u201cthe end of the world\u201d, I think a general mentality of conformity encompasses our society. \u00a0This is only natural, for people and animals alike to tighten together within a community when a sense of danger persists, a sense of uncertainty and lack of direction. \u00a0There are many valid conservative arguments against non-conformity; the notion that when you put yourself at exceptional risk, no one is obligated to save you. \u00a0Risk is a very complicated concept though, and as conservative as I am compelled to be in times like these, I think there is a very alluring and unusually noble concept behind it. \u00a0What makes these times so extraordinary is that they are filled with opportunity. \u00a0\n",
        "I\u2019ve been looking for motivation lately and have been having a hard time finding it. \u00a0I\u2019m my own worst enemy when I idle because I\u2019m left to my own devices and that\u2019s when I think the most. \u00a0I\u2019ve never felt so conformed to these times of uncertainty; when seeking for answers from my past or seeking for what might be in the future, I find very little. \u00a0When my thoughts race I start fooling myself into forgetting what makes me who I am. \u00a0I start trying to redefine myself by taking cues from my past and by attempting to project into the future. \u00a0I begin remembering all my failures and all my incomplete dreams. \u00a0It\u2019s right at that moment, that critical moment of anti-clarity that somehow yields a paramount moment of clarity. \u00a0\n",
        "All the things I used to want turned out to be things not suited for me \u2013 or perhaps I have changed to make that so. \u00a0Likewise, all the dreams that remain but still have been just beyond my reach will remain there \u2013 until I change to make them so. \u00a0My failure is my motivation.\n",
        "When the time comes to huddle together in the cold, when individual warmth won\u2019t suffice \u2013 it is at that moment new opportunities arise. \u00a0The opportunities to discover new answers fueled by questions unanswered, to learn new perspectives once hidden by myopic content. \u00a0In times of distress, the opportunity of \u201crisk\u201d arises and you are given the option of behaving ordinarily, or extra-ordinarily. \u00a0This is exactly why we live in marvelous times. \u00a0There is distress all around us and everyone is huddled to keep warm in the cold of distress. \u00a0Of course, we may all survive but only few will triumph. \u00a0These times are the making of awe-inspiring stories that will last \u2013 hopefully longer than a twitter trend.\n",

        "capitalism is slavery?! are you fucking kidding me? In America\u2019s most free and prosperous state we were the most Capitalist we\u2019ve ever been. The closer we get to socialism, the more power we give to our government, and te more money we give to our government, and they\u2019ve already proven that they do not know how to spend/save that money. You are clearly misguided or lost.\n",

        "As an amateur philosopher, I feel like this is the view most republicans and otherwise ignorant Americans have on socialism. \u00a0Contrary to the belief of these people, socialism is not necessarily control by the government, but more exactly a political philosophy or system that endorses the ownership and control of production by the cooperation of the people. \u00a0I would think that if anything, this is taking control away from the privatized industries, passing through the hands of the government, and into the hands of the people. \u00a0\n",
        "Now I can see where most people might be afraid of socialism, the rich afraid of losing power, and the poor afraid of submitting themselves to the government instead of private companies. \u00a0It seems depressing though to think that America as a people are incapable of watching the transfer of power from conglomerates to the government without actively revolting. \u00a0Socialism, especially in the state of our economy, is best for the people. \u00a0The minimum wage worker struggling to pay their bills will no longer have to sweat blood and tears while the CEO running the company they work for flies out to exotic countries to play golf with other CEOs. \u00a0Instead, CEOs give up the jets they own so that poorer citizens can afford the luxuries that most people call necessities such as a mode of transportation, or an education. \u00a0What is scary about socialism IS the overtaking of power by the government. \u00a0This is because of the conditioning we have been submitted to through the submersion of common knowledge in the propaganda filtered through the media. \u00a0We see other socialist countries that have succumbed to their leaders and see that the people are oppressed. \u00a0Therefore, we associate socialism with oppression. \u00a0However, I strongly believe that should the government take power from privately owned companies, and furthermore from the people, We as a country would not stand idly by to watch and cry. \u00a0Americans are much stronger than that, there will come a time when the economy that is falling down onto us will cause this house to collapse, and the only people that will be up to the task of rebuilding it are US.\n",

        "I woke up heartbroken. \u00a0\n",
        "I realized that I\u2019d cut ties with many people in my life, rarely intentionally, mostly due to carelessness and absent-mindedness. \u00a0It \u2018s that absent-mindedness though that I fought so hard to grow out of. \u00a0It was that absent-mindedness that gave me that dream, grasping at me from my sub-consciousness. \u00a0\n",
        "I wondered how my old friend was doing. \u00a0Last I\u2019d heard she was as happy as she\u2019d always wanted to be, but that was still a long, long time ago. \u00a0I realized that I\u2019d never actually told her what she meant to me. \u00a0I never got to blame her for introducing me to astrology which now influences a significant part of my life. \u00a0I never got to thank her for being a good friend, and to apologize for being a jackass when I was, which was probably a majority of the time she knew me. \u00a0\n",
        "Nevertheless, I found myself searching for a ghost no one knew how to find. \u00a0I began wondering if the dream I had wasn\u2019t just my sub-conscious, but an actual visit\u2026 \u00a0I searched everywhere for clues and hints \u2013 I became fuckin\u2019 Sherlock Holmes (I\u2019ve also been watching too much Burn Notice lately), but no solid leads means resorting to Xanga to let off a little bit. \u00a0I can\u2019t lie, my curiosity has kept me up hoping my dream was just a dream, and wondering if energy could be directed in such a fashion to communicate. \u00a0Sure, that\u2019s just me dreaming, but how real is real?\n",

        "\u00a0\n",
        "Social networking has taken off since its advent with sites like this one, and it\u2019s safe to say that its evolution will not stop here. \u00a0Websites have become services, catering to people of all ages, from all walks of life all over the world. \u00a0It has become easier to let the world know what you think of the guy sitting next to you than it has to say \u201chello\u201d to that guy sitting next to you. \u00a0There is no doubt that technology has granted people the accessibility to the world, and that accessibility is greatly appreciated, however it seems that technology is guiding the way our society evolves \u2013 instead of the other way around. \u00a0\n",
        "Everything has become globalized. \u00a0This very moment, someone is typing up their opinion on the world and in an instant that opinion can be read by millions. \u00a0On Wall Street one man\u2019s decisions can affect families on the other side of the globe. \u00a0The world has become less mysterious and more crowded without most of us even noticing. \u00a0Blindly as a whole we have watched our world unfold without our approval or disapproval. \u00a0We watch what happens, and we simply react.\u00a0\n",
        "I used to think that what mattered wasn\u2019t what happens to you, what matters more is how you react to it, but I\u2019m beginning to see that re-activity is actually becoming the definition of our generation. \u00a0When we see something on the news, we blog about it. \u00a0When hear something funny, we tweet it. \u00a0When we see something unusual, we catch it on camera and post it on YouTube. \u00a0It seems like our ability to act has succumb to our instinct to react. \u00a0Is this simply because that\u2019s how we are? \u00a0Or is it because it\u2019s how we\u2019ve been conditioned to be?\n",
        "Human nature hasn\u2019t changed one bit. \u00a0While technology has exponentially evolved, we haven\u2019t made too many advances as a race to match its speed. \u00a0Much like giving a baby a calculator, it seems that we\u2019re losing less and less sense of how to deal with things around us \u2013 and so all we can do is react. \u00a0As connected as the world is by social networking, the world is just as disconnected as ever. \u00a0When you look up to the sky (saying you\u2019ve ever done it), does it ever occur to you that there are things going on beyond the atmosphere? \u00a0\n",
        "I used to look up to the sky and think \u2013 it\u2019s amazing how walking down the street, people very rarely look up. \u00a0I\u2019m not blaming them though because really, why would they? \u00a0The tops of buildings serve the best means for privacy \u2013 I saw not too long ago advertising for rentals with pools on the roofs of apartment buildings. \u00a0I thought to myself, now THERE\u2019S a place to get away to. \u00a0Not some exotic tropical island, or a national park, but the top of a building. \u00a0It makes sense why superheroes are always perched at the top of a building, no one would ever know they were there. \u00a0\n",
        "We walk, eyes locked forward, and in many cases our gaze is forced away from the possibility of eye contact with strangers walking by. \u00a0We\u2019ve achieved global social connectivity, but we can\u2019t smile at strangers\u2026 \u00a0Doesn\u2019t that confuse you a bit? \u00a0Granted, the concept of small social circles is rooted in our animal instincts to survive; when we were not as connected we stuck to what we knew to avert danger, but our world isn\u2019t like that anymore. \u00a0We don\u2019t plant our own dinners and we don\u2019t deter bears from our caves with spears. \u00a0We find things \u201ccreepy\u201d and \u201cawkward\u201d and \u201cweird\u201d, but we\u2019ve seen everything happen around the world right from the comfort of our own computer chairs. \u00a0\n",
        "My point isn\u2019t that technology has hindered us, it\u2019s quite the opposite really. \u00a0We have let technology flourish. \u00a0The problem is that we have given most of our attention to technology, and less attention to ourselves. \u00a0Just as we\u2019ve been conditioned to react to what we see online, we react to our instincts. \u00a0We\u2019ve left most of the thinking to our computers and all of the doing to everyone else. \u00a0When was the last time someone tried to make eye contact with you and smiled \u2013 and you immediately looked at your cell phone like someone more important was calling you \u2013 i\u2019m sorry, tagging you on Facebook. \u00a0Before we becoming comfortably acquainted with the globalization of social networking, I think it\u2019s more important that we globalize human nature. \u00a0The argument of that possibility is a completely separate topic, but as of now it seems impossible because we all know that human nature is a very tricky thing. \u00a0That being the case however, in terms of \u201cfriending\u201d people we don\u2019t know \u2013 we still have a very long way to go.\n",

        "I found an interview online of an entrepreneur who was asked what to major in should someone want to be an entrepreneur\u2026  He discussed the idea that majors do not always translate into careers and then continued to say \u201d the best advice ever given to me was to choose my major as if I were to die at graduation\u2026\u201d. I\u2019ve been repeating that quote for almost a week, so much that it\u2019s become my mantra while here, in life limbo\u2026  So far I only know that chemistry isn\u2019t what I want to be doing with my life and should I die at graduation the one thing I would regret not studying is philosophy.  The one thing I would regret not doing is traveling the world, meeting new people, helping make the world a better place \u2013 not indrectly, but directly.  I want to create ways for people to live happier, easier, less stressful lives.  It was after realizing this that people began telling me I would make a good diplomat or detective or something like that\u2026  I\u2019m closer to where I\u2019m supposed to be but I\u2019m not quite there just yet..  \n",

His response went something like this:\n",
        "\u201cWhat that means to me, is that it\u2019s very important to study something you love and that is rudimentary to your happiness.

        "there is an interesting paradox behind the goal of enlightenment.\u00a0 The Bhagavad Gita says \u201cFree yourself from anger and desire\u2026\u00a0 This is the means by which you come to know the soul, and thereby attain the highest spiritual state.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is possibly the essence of Buddhism and enlightenment \u2013 to release yourself from need and desire.\u00a0 For what though?\u00a0 The common conception of enlightenment is that you seperate yourself from desire in order to attain ultimate happiness.\u00a0 But what is the goal of attaining happiness \u2013 a lesser and broader form of desire.\u00a0 \n",
        "Like the difference between the naturally gifted and those who seek to become the naturally gifted, it seems that the best way to seek enlightenment is to naturally be enlightened, or, enlightenment-ready.\u00a0 And enlightenment can, oddly enough, be compared to any other goal in life.\u00a0 Enlightenment can be synonomous with success.\u00a0 \u2018The best way to succeed is to naturally be successful\u2019 \u2026.\u00a0 Maybe I put it too harshly.\u00a0 More simply \u2013 the best way to go about certain tasks is not to seek the goal itself directly, but to understand and appreciate the benefits of the goal, and to make them a part of your lifestyle.\u00a0 And this way, you are not directly working for this goal, you are already living it, and simply expanding.\n",

That is, one feels that everything that happens is destiny\u2018s way of reaching its ultimate purpose, and so should be considered good. Moreover, it is characterized by an acceptance of the events that occur in one\u2019s life. It is almost identical to the Jewish concept of Gam Zu Letovah (this too is for the best).\n",

        "i shall use my deductive logic to answer my own question: why is it so hard to find a good girl?\n",
        "the problem stems from the beginning of each process.\u00a0 a club.\u00a0 a party.\u00a0 a frat.\u00a0 a bar.\u00a0 it\u2019s hard not to find anyone who does not fall under a category (ie. \u201cthe filipino girl\u201d, \u201cthe korean girl\u201d, \u201cthe spanish girl\u201d, \u201cthe white girl\u201d..).\u00a0 i suppose it\u2019s because..\u00a0 maybe because people want to be found.\u00a0 so people do things that people are familiar with.\u00a0 and the most familiar things are typically stereotypes.\u00a0 even though we all want to be original, we all end up being similar.\u00a0 now that i think about it it\u2019s the same for most guys too.\u00a0 guys use pickup lines, tagteams, methods to pick up a chick\u2026\u00a0 the most common method nowadays of finding a date is unfortunately the same method people use every day \u2013 social networking.\u00a0 facebook, myspace, friendster, etc\u2026\u00a0 people want to fit in so we do things that other people do.\u00a0 either that or people are just extremely, uneccesarily bored.\u00a0 but then after awhile, among these people, everyone becomes homologous.\n",
        "back to the topic of bars, clubs, and so on, most people go there for the same reason.\u00a0 and the fact that people are there for the same reason makes it HARDER to find a certain someone.\u00a0 so instead of going out to a club in hopes of finding that special person, it turns out the odds of that happening are essentially less.\u00a0 and ultimately, the people that we do meet at these social gatherings turn out to be the people we aren\u2019t really looking for.\u00a0 either because we\u2019re drunk or just don\u2019t care. [i wonder if this has anything to do with the current divorce/marriage percentage].\u00a0 \n",
        "[hmm i really should be writing a paper or studying instead of this]\n",
        "and then to further complicate things, when you DON\u2019T go to a place of social gathering, the people you meet are not there on a mission.\u00a0 you don\u2019t go to a coffee shop in the city expecting to find your soulmate.\u00a0 the blind eye is there more than ever.\u00a0 so here, you have two extremes.\u00a0 a social gathering, and an individual\u2019s niche.\n",

        "\u00a0\u00a0I could write about how flawed American society is.\u00a0 How we all fall prey to Corporate America, to one extent or another.\u00a0 I could write about how we all need to come together, because as a country, we\u2019re a broken home.\u00a0 I could write about how all we think about is ourselves; just as the late George Carlin said \u201c[it takes] a fuckin catastrophe to get us to care for one another\u201d. \u00a0 I could talk about how self-centered we are \u2013 the minute we hear a Nostradamus quatrain, we automatically look to apply it to anything that has to do with us and America:  I could tell you that we all need a new conciousness of one another, and that we all live in this world together, in a place where individualism and commercialism are buying us and isolating us and alienating us.\u00a0 I could tell you that we are an irresponsible country, blaming everything on gas, or blaming everything on our boss, or blaming everything on our school, or blaming everything on our President.\u00a0 I could talk about how our generation loves to scapegoat, blackmail, double-cross, and sabotage. I would tell you that when the next war comes around, we\u2019ll be like deer in headlights because none of us knows what it might be like.\u00a0 When gas prices go up we bitch and whine but still buy gas anyway, because we believe in commercialism, or, we\u2019re promised that gas will go back down, or, the President tells us that he\u2019s gonna find more oil, or, Japan sells us cars that run on less gasoline.\u00a0 I could tell you that instead of going along with what Big Business tells us to do, we should look for alternatives, improve our lives, instead of just following a par set by companies.I could talk about alot of things.\u00a0 I would tell you everything that matters and why.\u00a0 But honestly, I won\u2019t because of this cycle.\u00a0 Few of you who see this will say yeah, something fishy\u2019s going on\u2026\u00a0 But even few of you will follow through and act on it.\u00a0 If I could, I would go further than telling you and just uniting us into a cause far greater than our own individually.\u00a0 But I doubt everyone else would follow.So, I\u2019ll just have to look forward to the day when I can find myself somewhere else.\u00a0\u00a0Like maybe, hopefully, here for example:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Remember George Carlin: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1uaw3WIOlclol\u2026 \u201ctonight\u2019s forecast\u2026\u00a0 dark.\u201d\n",

        "READ THIS\u2026 Beware of practicing your piety before men in order to be seen by them; for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. Thus, when you give alms, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by men. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your alms may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you. And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by men. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you. And in praying do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. Pray then like this: Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; And forgive us our debts, As we also have forgiven our debtors; And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father also will forgive you; but if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. And when you fast, do not look dismal, like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by men.Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, that your fasting may not be seen by men but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you. Matthew 6:1-18\n",

WolfI appreciate that quote, but disagree with the latter part.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think cynicism follows idealism.\u00a0 I just think conservatism follows liberalism.\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s a sort of, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go!\u201d kind of rush that turns into a \u201cWhoa, okay, slow down\u201d sort of thing.I haven\u2019t been able to produce a proper entry because, I suppose I haven\u2019t been able to produce a proper thought.\u00a0 Ironic, a proper thought may come along as a sit down with a beer\u2026\u00a0 Let me see.\u00a0I had a dream a couple of nights ago.\u00a0 There was this girl I really wanted to talk to, but never had the balls to just randomly go up and say something to her.\u00a0 I guess I was never much of the bravado type.\u00a0 She was beautiful though, her smile was, for lack of a more proper term, bananas.\u00a0 One time in\u00a0class she sat next to me, and did that herbal essence hair flip.\u00a0 Ever since then, I was sold -_-.\u00a0 I never said anything though, because I dunno.\u00a0 I was always with my friends, she was always with hers.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think I ever had the right opportunity to talk to her.\u00a0 I\u2019d use the question line like \u201chey, what\u2019d\u00a0he say\u201d because I always had my friends there to ask and I woulda just looked like a complete tool.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t catch her after class because, again, me with my friends, her with hers\u2026.\u00a0 Not enough rabura I guess.\u00a0 But either way, it just didn\u2019t feel right.\u00a0 And me, I operate based very religiously on feelings\u2026.\u00a0 Call it, passionate instinct.\u00a0 I do, however regret not being a ballsy talker, but hey.\u00a0 Chaos Theory.So go figure, I have a dream the night before the final.\u00a0 I\u2019m walking through some kind of library.\u00a0 Apparently, I\u2019m following this girl.\u00a0 I keep following her and bump into a couple people I know, and then continue to follow her.\u00a0 I follow her to the back of the huge library-like room, where I see all these paintings, I remember one was very blue and white.\u00a0 Something like the sky.\u00a0 Made me think of God.\u00a0 She walked through a door, and I didn\u2019t follow her.I still wonder what that dream meant.\u00a0 The next day, I took the final, aced it, and still, didn\u2019t say anything to her.\u00a0 I could kick myself.\u00a0 But hey, Chaos Theory.After thinking about the dream, I wonder, it just wasn\u2019t meant to be.\u00a0 I remember one time looking at a horoscope that mine said \u201cAquarius, [something, something, don\u2019t feel impatient about love because of something like, I have my schedule, and that one person for me has hers.]\u201d\u00a0 Basically, to be patient.\u00a0 I wondered why it didn\u2019t feel right, saying anything, even though I had a whole semester to\u2026\u00a0 And I figure.\u00a0 I\u2019m not ready yet.\u00a0 I have other things to take care of.\u00a0 And I do.\u00a0 So I comply with myself, I submit to my conscience.\u00a0 For once, my feelings do correlate to my needs.\u00a0 I aced my final, and the next two that are left, I\u2019m acing those too.\u00a0 I\u2019m getting a job, and taking summer classes.\u00a0 I\u2019m moving out sooner before I know it, and those bluetooth headphones I really, really want?\u00a0 They\u2019re practically mine.\u00a0 And then, when I do catch that apartment in Pavonia, when I drop that BMW 6 coupe\u2026\u00a0 Lol okay, how about, a Toyota Prius.\u00a0 Then, maybe, God willing, I\u2019ll be forgiven for being a wuss, and get my second chance.Hey, Chaos Theory.and HOLY SHIT, i\u2019ve had this thing since 11/28/2002.\u00a0 6 years of my life is on this website -_-\u00a0i think i\u2019ll print this whole thing out and make a freakin book.\u00a0 lol bog fordid xanga shuts down without notice =O lol\n",

        "life can be frustrating.\u00a0 that\u2019s all there is to it.\u00a0 at least that\u2019s how it seems at first because when life IS frustrating, it never really matters to us why, or how it became this way.\u00a0 all that matter really is that the frustration just STOPS.\u00a0 we seek help from people, but why.\u00a0 we feel that the more other people are involved, the less the burden becomes on our own shoulders.\u00a0 but no.\u00a0 what people really seek help for is the strength to overcome their own troubles.\u00a0 we turn to our friends for help because they make us strong.\u00a0 not because they solve the problem, but because we find that when we do find someone to relate to, someone we can depend on limitlessly, we ultimately find that life is not so bad.\u00a0 life is not so tough because we were not stuck in it alone.\u00a0 believe it or not, because it\u2019s true.\u00a0 when we feel down and out and no one can solve our problems, there ARE people out there who care.\u00a0 and if you truly do believe that no one cares, and that all you need is one person in the world to solve your problems, your problem is no longer that your life is SHIT.\u00a0 but now your problem is you find no one to relate to.\u00a0 that no longer becomes your problem, but a problem with the world.\u00a0 because if the world lacks the people power to make you feel that the world is sufficient enough, then apparently your problem is not just your problem but the whole world\u2019s problem as well.\u00a0 it\u2019s interesting, that you might find some comfort in the fact that when you find the world cannot suffice, there are also people thinking the same exact thing.\u00a0 and therefore you are truly not alone.\u00a0 not only do you have such passion in common with other people but your actions speak as softly as those thinking the same thing as you.\u00a0 \n",
        "so what do you do.\n",

        "so when frustration comes along carrying stress and trouble, trials and tribulations on its back, i say, face it with eagerness.\u00a0 because when you overcome a test put forth to you, you become stronger from it.\u00a0 feel the need to become stronger, the necessity to succeed.\u00a0 your life will affect the lives of others and when others see success around them they too will feel the possibility that they might just be able to overcome.\u00a0 we all affect each others lives because we\u2019re all watching each other\u2019s movies, and yet\u2026\u00a0 all the while when our movies are playing and intertwining with each other, this thing we call life is one big \u201cmovie\u201d in itself.\n",
        "don\u2019t be the character who makes the audience say \u201cwhat ever happened to that person?\u2026\u201d\u00a0 \n",
        "we all want the same thing \u2013 a happy ending.\u00a0 and we\u2019re all part of the same problem, therefore we must all\u2026\u00a0 ALL be part of the solution.\u00a0 find that our troubles are just there to test us.\u00a0 to see if we really are capable of bringing \u201cus\u201d up.\u00a0 don\u2019t give in, don\u2019t give up.\u00a0 we all have it in ourselves to make it to where we want to go, but always remember we always have it in each other.\u00a0 we may feel alone and that no one else is necessary but even then.\u00a0 even if we want to be alone in this world, we can\u2019t.\u00a0 realize that it is really a small world.\n",
        "i can only express so much through words, and plus, most people would be sickened by hearing that they have a higher responsibility for their fellow man.\u00a0 that\u2019s simply because of fear of reality.\u00a0 fear of failure.\u00a0 fear. \n",
        "so as you go on with your life, wanting everything to be, just \u201cokay\u201d, go ahead thinking that when YOU feel \u201cjust fine\u201d, the world is all and well.\u00a0 but keep this in mind, that you may be a part of something with great magnitude, something of extraordinary proportions.\u00a0 you take that glass in your hand and you drink up.\u00a0 but think about it.\u00a0 life may actually be more than what we think it really is\u2026\n",

        "Jesus said to his disciples: \u201cThere will be signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars, and on earth nations will be in dismay, perplexed by the roaring of the sea and the waves.\u00a0 People will die of fright in anticipation of what is coming upon the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.\u00a0 And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.\u00a0 But when these signs begin to happen, stand erect and raise your heads because your redemption is at hand.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBeware that your hearts do not become drowsy from carousing and drunkenness and the anxiety of daily life, and that day catch you by surprise like a trap.\u00a0 For that day will assault everyone who lives on the face of the earth.\u00a0 Be vigilant at all times and pray that you have the strength to escape the tribulations that are imminent and to stand before the Son of Man.\u201d\n",

        "Fuck \u201cThe Organization Kid\u201d.\u00a0 This is the topic of the day.What society fails to realize is that hope is the sole provider of life.\u00a0 It is hope, and hope alone which fuels our economy, fuels our democracy, fuels our aristocracy and poverty, and it is hope which fuels our religion.\u00a0 It is hope which propels us to get up out of bed in the morning, and go back to bed at night.\u00a0 It is hope which keeps us moving, and hope which keeps us from not going far enough.These days it\u2019s all about watching out for self.\u00a0 Take care of your self.\u00a0 Watch out for my self.\u00a0 Everything is about self.\u00a0 Chivalry is dead and gone, but hope is here forever.\u00a0 Like the oxygen which bonds the two hydrogens to create water, the universal solvent, it is hope which bonds life with time.\u00a0 We hope that we live another day, we hope that everything goes right.\u00a0 We hope that everything turns out for the best, or we hope that we grow.Why do you keep going?\u00a0 Why not stop now, why not quit.\u00a0 I could be generic and go all formal essay on your ass and say, hey\u2026\u00a0 King Jr. never quit.\u00a0 Lincoln never quit.\u00a0 Kennedy never quit.\u00a0 (What strikes me now is the fact that they were all assassinated\u2026 hmmm\u2026.)\u00a0 But nevermind that.\u00a0 They never quit.\u00a0 That was what made them great.\u00a0 The fact that they had the spirit to keep going, to go beyond what any normal character would have stopped at.\u00a0 They went for it.\u00a0 I could say that.\u00a0 Or, I could tell you the not-so-obvious.\u00a0 Hope is what brings knowledge, and what fuels life itself.\u00a0 If it were not for hope, if it were not for the desire to keep going, the passion to stick it, what would our world be like now?\u00a0 What if we were content with what we had?\u00a0 Slaves would be slaves, masters would be masters.\u00a0 Human sacrifices would be human sacrifices and cannibalism would be today\u2019s vegetarian.\u00a0 We fight for what we believe is right.\u00a0 Hope is what fuels our passion.\u00a0 My cousin once asked the rest of us cousins what makes a good military leader.\u00a0 At first I said imagination, the ability to innovate.\u00a0 Others said determination, passion, and intelligence.\u00a0 But now my answer is: hope.\u00a0 Hope is what makes us keep going beyond what we would normally stop at.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 Because like the adrenaline that pumps in our veins, hope is what causes us to go that one last mile.I\u2019m losing myself now.\u00a0 Just like how I did in the essay i\u2019m supposed to be editing right now.\u00a0 So i\u2019ll leave it at this.\u00a0Life\u00a0may be\u00a0short, love\u00a0may be\u00a0blind.\u00a0 But hope is why.\u00a0\u201cPain is what gives love its integrity.\u00a0 And as self-mutilation is the greatest magnitude of pain, it is the strongest way to find what you truly love..\u201d\n",

        "and was it amazing\u2026so as i slowly creep towards the point where i can full-fledgedly call myself a senior, i lose all sense of immaturity and with that, all sense of reality. which would seem at first contradictory but that\u2019s what life is isn\u2019t it. so i\u2019ve lost all sense of reality. \u201cwhy, chris? why have you lost all sense of reality?\u201d well, bitch. i\u2019ll tell you why. (;snicker) well, over the past couple of weeks, my biological clock hasn\u2019t been\u2026 well\u2026 let\u2019s just say my clock has been flashing \u201c12:00\u2026 12:00\u2026 12:00\u2033 for quite a long time now; my clock \u2013 has officially been unplugged from the wall. and because of that, i have went through, oh what. 8 nights (not consecutively though) without sleep. 2 of them were consecutive. the rest were just\u2026 random. weird much? yeah, sure. so i don\u2019t sleep. \u201cbig deal, moron, none of us ever really sleep..\u201d well, of course, who sleeps these days? but the thing is \u2026 well\u2026 research says that after about 18 hours without sleep, your body\u2019s dexterity and cognitive abilities are equivalent to someone with the BAC (blood-alcohol content) level of .05%\u2026 longer periods resemble levels of around .1%\u2026 (my point?) BAC level of a legally intoxicated person in New Jersey has been lowered previously to .08%\u2026 \u2026.shit, i drive drunk\u2026anyway, so i didn\u2019t sleep last night again (don\u2019t know why, still haven\u2019t figured it out).. but i decided that i\u2019d go for a drive at 5:30 in the morning\u2026 only a couple hours ago.. stopped by quik chek to grab some food, thought about where i should go\u2026 a stream of cars was released by the green onto first ave only seconds after i got back in my car, so i figured i\u2019d wait at the waiting red\u2026 facing down old york in my dad\u2019s amazingly responsive \u201999 chevrolet prizm, i grabbed a sausage, egg and cheese sandwich out of the plastic bag next to me.. left pinky on the wheel, i unwrapped my breakfast for a good 2 minutes and started eating\u2026 now, the whole time, I thought that the road would lead me to the little underpass that takes you to milltown road.. yeah, yeh know what i\u2019m talking about, the one passing north branch par \u2013 no you don\u2019t know eh\u2026 well yeah apparently, after 10 minutes, i had NO clue of where i was.. not spazzed because i was.. driving in the bloom of broad daylight\u2026 i figured, just keep going.. you have 30 minutes to burn and half a tank of gas\u2026gas, by the way, has now reached what\u2026 a range of $2.59-$2.71/gal. (?!\u2026 crazy.)so i keep going down old york road.. i started to feel a certain\u2026 lost in the fog at sea \u2013 feeling as i winded down old york road.. thanks to my dominos experience and what with our store delivering to a big area of somerset county \u2013 i remembered that old york eventually winds into branchburg\u2026 \u201cbranchburg?! shit..\u201d i said.. but then i shrugged, opened up my bag of milano ;grin\u2026 the sun was already pretty much up and it was \u2013 beautiful.. it was simply incredible, the feeling of being awake and there for the sun to come up.. like when a mom and dad are watching their infant as it slowly wakes up.. it\u2019s that kind of\u2026 content, peaceful feeling.. just simply inexplicable. the sun was breaking through a patch of clouds which were slowly colliding together in the blue/off violet sky.. the reddish tint was going away and the blue was just overtaking the rest of the horizon. oh yeah, and i got lost. this guy in a buick who apparently thought he was bad ass so he rode my bumper till i again \u2013 sprayed his ass. kicked him down about 10 mph ;grin..but i just kept going straight, even though i was lost.. dunno why, or what compelled me to do so, i just did.. i opened up my bottle of fuze \u2013 and this song came on the stereo.. turned the bass up alll the way \u2013 as far as i could on that damn chevrolet =P but all in all, the experience was just \u2026 well for lack of better description.. it was very satisfying. calming and satisfying. i just wished i\u2019d have someone to come with me next time \u2026\n",
